# Welcome
If you have the key, then this should be a simple exercise.
Here is something to help you along the way though...
Imagine you are in a room, and in walks 2 Belgians.
They are carrying something, it is a giant number 2
followed by a caret and then a small 8.

They look at you and say "We need this two get past the gate".
Off they go, but before they are through the door, you also see a
block and they block has a chain around it!


Good Luck!
